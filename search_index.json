Тим не менш, це не передбачає досвід роботи з Clojure або функціональним програмуванням. Ми будемо намагатися додавати посилання на довідкові матеріал, коли мова буде йти про теоретичні основи ClojureScript, які можуть бути незнайомі.\nДокументація ClojureScript непогана але поверхнева, тому ми хотіли написати збірник довідкової інформації і прикладів, що б слугували прикладом, а також серією практичних керівництв.

Тому що Clojure рулить, а JavaScript сягає усюди.\n— Річ Хікі (Rich Hickey)\n\nClojureScript — це імплементація мови програмування Clojure, орієнтована на JavaScript. Завдяки цьому, вона може працювати в багатьох різних середовищах виконання, включаючи веб-браузери, Node.js, io.js та Nashorn.\nНа відміну від інших мов, які призначені компілюватися в JavaScript (такі, як TypeScript, FunScript або CoffeScript), ClojureScript створена використовувати JavaScript як байткод. Це дуже надійна та безпечна мова, що заохочує до функціонального програмування. Її семантика істотно відрізняється від JavaScript.\nЩе однією великою відмінністю (і, на нашу думку, перевагою) від інших мов є те, що Clojure призначена бути гостьовою мовою. Це мова без власної віртуальної машини, яка може бути легко адаптована до нюансів середовища виконання. Перевагою для Clojure (а, отже, і для ClojureScript) є те, що вона має доступ до всіх існуючих бібліотек, написаних на батьківській мові.\nПеред тим, як ми розпочнемо, давайте підсумуємо деякі з основних ідей в ClojureScript. Не переймайтеся, якщо ви не розумієте їх зараз — по ходу книги вони стануть більш зрозумілі.\n\nClojureScript нав'язує парадигму функціонального програмування з її ідеями та ідіомами. Але хоч вона і підтримує функціональне програмування, в ній все ж більше прагматизму, ніж бажання переслідувати теоретичну чистоту;\nзаохочує до використання незмінних даних в програмуванні та пропонує високоефективні та розвинені імплементації незмінних колекцій;\nвстановлює чітку відмінність ідентичності від ії стану, надаючи явні конструкції для керування зміною стану в вигляді послідовності незмінних значень створених з плином часу;\nвона має поліморфізм на основі типів і значень, що елегантно вирішує проблему вираження;\nце діалект Lisp, тому програми написані структурами даних самої мови. Ця властивість відома як гомоіконність, що робить метапрограмування (програми, які пишуть програми) дуже простим;\n\nРазом ці ідеї дуже впливають на те, як ви проектуєте та розробляєте програмне забезпечення, навіть якщо ви не використовуєте ClojureScript. Функціональне програмування, роз'єднуюче дані (що є незмінними) від перетворючих їх операцій, явні ідіоми для керування зміною, що відбувається з плином часу та поліморфні конструкції для програмування абстракцій значно спрощують системи, що ми пишемо.\n\nМи можемо робити точно таке ж програмне забезпечення, що ми робимо сьогодні, викорустовуючи значно простіші речі: значно простіші мови, інструменти, методи, підходи.\n— Річ Хікі (Rich Hickey)\n\nМи сподіваємося, що вам сподобається книга і ClojureScript принесе таку ж радість і натхнення, яку принесла й нам.\n"},"manuscript/03-01-First-steps-with-Lisp-syntax.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-01-First-steps-with-Lisp-syntax.html","title":"Перші кроки з Lisp–синтаксисом","keywords":"","body":"Перші кроки з Lisp–синтаксисом\nМова Lisp була розроблена Джоном МакКарті у 1958 році і на сьогодні є однією з найдавніших мов програмування, що досі використовуються. Від Lisp походить велика кількість мов, які називають діалектами Lisp. ClojureScript – один з таких діалектів. На мові Lisp програми пишуть за допомогою структур даних самої Lisp – списків у дужках, але Clojure(Script) додала до первинного синтаксису Lisp нові структури даних, завдяки чому код на Clojure(Script) більш приємно писати та читати.\nУ ClojureScript список, першим елементом якого є функція, використовується для виклику функції. У наступному прикладі ми викликаємо функцію додавання із трьома аргументами. Зверніть увагу на те, що у мовах родини Lisp знаком + позначають не оператор, а функцію. Операторів у Lisp немає – лише функції.\n(+ 1 2 3)\n;; => 6\n\nУ цьому прикладі ми застосовуємо функцію додавання + до трьох аргументів 1, 2 та 3. ClojureScript дозволяє використовувати знаки питання, тире та численні інші незвичайні знаки у назвах символів, що спрощує сприйняття коду:\n(zero? 0)\n;; => true\n\nДля розрізнення викликів функцій та списків даних ми можемо цитувати списки за допомогою функції quote і тим самим заборонити їх обчислення. Цитовані списки сприймаються компілятором як дані, а не як виклик функції:\n'(+ 1 2 3)\n;; => (+ 1 2 3)\n\nСинтаксис ClojureScript не обмежується списками. Детальну інформацію з цього питання ви знайдете у подальших розділах, а зараз лише наведемо приклад використання вектора (у прямокутних дужках) для визначення локальних звʼязувань (bindings):\n(let [x 1\n      y 2\n      z 3]\n  (+ x y z))\n;; => 6\n\nЦе майже усе, що нам потрібно знати про синтаксис для написання коду на ClojureScript, а також на будь-якому іншому діалекті Lisp. Мови, які підтримують написання коду з використанням власних структур даних (їх називають гомоіконічними), мають багато переваг завдяки простому та однорідному синтаксису. Зокрема генерація коду за допомогою макросів у таких мовах простіша ніж, у інших, що дає розробникам змогу розширяти мову за власними потребами.\n"},"manuscript/03-02-The-base-data-types.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-02-The-base-data-types.html","title":"Базові типи даних","keywords":"","body":"Основні типи даних\nМова ClojureScript, як і більшість мов програмування має багатий набір типів даних.

Також, в ній є багато інших, з якими ви можете бути незнайомі, такі як символи, ключові слова, регекспи (регулярні вирази), змінні, атоми та волатайли (volatile).\nClojureScript використовує типи даних батьківської платформи, коли це можливо. Наприклад: числа та рядки використовуються і поводяться так само, як і в JavaScript.\nЧисла\nВ ClojureScript числа включають в себе цілі числа та числа з рухомою крапкою. Враховуючи те, що ClojureScript це гостьова мова, що компілюється в JavaScript, під капотом цілі числа насправді є числами з рухомою крапкою в JavaScript.\nЯк і в багатьох інших мовах, в ClojureScript числа представлені в наступних форматах:\n23\n+23\n-100\n1.7\n-2\n33e8\n12e-14\n3.2e-4\n\nКлючові слова\nВ ClojureScript ключові слова — це тип даних, в якому значення означають нічого іншого крім самих себе. Вони використовуються, як ключі в мапах для ефективного доступу до значень.\n:foobar\n:2\n:?\n:foo/bar\n\nЯк ви можете бачити, ключові слова починаються зі знаку :, але цей знак не є частиною імені об'єкту — він лише частина синтаксису літералу ключового слова.\nТакож ключове слово можна створити, викликавши функцію keyword. Не турбуйтесь, якщо ви нічого не зрозумієте в наступному прикладі; функції будуть розглянуті пізніше.\n(keyword \"foo\")\n;; => :foo\n\nСимволи\nВ ClojureScript символи дуже схожі на ключові слова (про які ви тепер знаєте). Але замість того, щоб означати тільки самих себе, символи означають те, на що вони посилаються: функція, значення, тощо.\nСимволи не можуть починатися цифрою, але можуть мати алфавітно-цифрові літери, а також знаки *, +, !, -, _, ', і ?, наприклад:\nsample-symbol\nothersymbol\nf1\nmy-special-swap!\n\nНе хвилюйтесь якщо ви не розумієте цього зараз; символи використовуються практично у всіх наших прикладах, що дозволяє вам вивчити більше по ходу.\nРядки\nМи не розкажемо нічого нового, чого ви можете не знати про рядки. В ClojureScript вони працюють так само, як і в будь-якій іншій мові. Цікаво лише те, що вони незмінні.\nВони такі ж самі, як і в JavaScript:\n\"An example of a string\"\n\nАле, завдяки синтаксису Lisp, особливим аспектом рядків у ClojureScript є те, що одно- та багаторядкові рядки мають той самий синтаксис:\n\"This is a multiline\n      string in ClojureScript.\"\n\nЛітери\nClojureScript також дозволяє писати окремі літери, використовуючи синтаксис літерала з Clojure.\n\\a        ; The lowercase a character\n\\newline  ; The newline character\n\nОскільки батьківська мова не має синтаксису для літералу літери, в ClojureScript літери представлені як рядки з JavaScript з однією літерою.\nКолекції\nЩе одним значним кроком у поясненні мови — є пояснення її колекцій та абстракцій колекції. ClojureScript не є винятком.\nВ ClojureScript є багато типів колекцій. Головною відмінністю колекцій в ClojureScript від колекцій в інших мовах є те, що вони стійкі (persistent) та незмінні.\nПеред тим, як перейти до цих (можливо) невідомих понять, ми розглянемо існуючі типи колекцій в ClojureScript.\nСписки\nЦе класичний тип колекції в мовах родини Lisp. В ClojureScript списки — найпростіший тип колекції. Списки можуть містити елементи будь-якого типу, включаючи інші колекції.\nВ ClojureScript списки представлені як ряд значень у круглих дужках:\n'(1 2 3 4 5)\n'(:foo :bar 2)\n\nЯк ви можете бачити, приклади списків мають префікс '. Це тому, що в мовах родини Lisp списки часто використовуються для вираження виклику функції чи макросу. В такому випадку, першим елементом повинен бути символ, що означає щось, що можна викликати (функцію), а решта елементів будуть аргументами цієї функції. Однак, у цьому прикладі ми не хочемо, щоб перший елемент був символом; ми хочемо список елементів.\nНаступний приклад показує відмінність списку без та з одинарними лапками:\n(inc 1)\n;; => 2\n\n'(inc 1)\n;; => (inc 1)\n\nЯк ви можете побачити, якщо ви виконаєте (inc 1) без префіксу ', символ inc стане функцією, що буде викликана з аргументом 1 і поверне результат 2.\nСписок можна створити явно за допомогою функції list:\n(list 1 2 3 4 5)\n;; => (1 2 3 4 5)\n\n(list :foo :bar 2)\n;; => (:foo :bar 2)\n\nСписки особливі тим, що доступ до першого елементу та послідовний доступ до наступних є дуже ефективним, але вони не будуть вдалим вибором, коли вам потрібен випадковий (по індексу) доступ до елементів.\nВектори\nТак само, як і списки, вектори містять ряд значень, але в цьому випадку, вони мають дуже ефективний доступ по індексу, на відміну від списків, які обчислюються поступово. Не турбуйтесь; в наступних частинах ми розглянемо це більш детально, але зараз простого пояснення буде більш ніж достатньо.\nВектори викорустовують квадратні дужки в синтаксисі літералу; давайте розглянемо кілька прикладів:\n[:foo :bar]\n[3 4 5 nil]\n\nЯк і списки, вектори можуть містити об’єкти будь-якого типу, що видно з попереднього прикладу.\nВектор також можна створити за допомогою функції vector, але звичайно це не використовується:\n(vector 1 2 3)\n;; => [1 2 3]\n\n(vector \"blah\" 3.5 nil)\n;; => [\"blah\" 3.5 nil]\n\nМапи\nМапа — це абстракція колекції, що дозволяє зберігати дані у вигляді пар ключ-значення. В інших мовах цей тип даних часто відомий як хеш-мапа або dict (словник). Літерал мапи в ClojureScript записується парами ключ-значення між фігурними дужками.\n{:foo \"bar\", :baz 2}\n{:alphabet [:a :b :c]}\n\n\nПримітка.\nКоми часто використовуються для поділу пар ключ-значення, але це не є обов’язковим. У синтаксисі ClojureScript, коми — це пробіли.\n\nЯк і в векторах, кожен елемент в літералі мапи обчислюється перед збереженням у саму мапу, але порядок обчислення та збереження не гарантується.\nМножини\nІ нарешті, множини.\nМножина — це невпорядкований ряд унікальних елементів будь-якого типу. Як і в мапах, літерал множини має фігурні дужки, але перед ними додається знак #. Можна також використовувати функцію set для конвертування колекцій у множини:\n#{1 2 3 :foo :bar}\n;; => #{1 :bar 3 :foo 2}\n(set [1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5])\n;; => #{1 2 3 4 5}\n\nУ наступних розділах ми розглянемо множини та інші типи колекцій більш детально.\n"},"manuscript/03-03-Vars.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-03-Vars.html","title":"Змінні","keywords":"","body":"Змінні\nClojureScript — це функціональна мова, зосереджена на незмінності даних. Через це, в ній немає поняття змінної, яке ви знаєте з багатьох інших мов програмування. Найбільш близькою аналогією до змінних будуть змінні в алгебрі; коли в математиці ми кажемо x = 6, це означає, що символу x відповідає число 6.\nВ ClojureScript змінні представлені символами і містять в собі значення разом з метаданими.\nЗмінну можна створити за допомогою спеціальної форми def:\n(def x 22)\n(def y [1 2 3])\n\nЗмінні завжди знаходяться на вищому рівні у просторі імен (про які ми поговоримо пізніше). Якщо використати def у функції, змінна все одно буде створена на рівні простору імен. Ми не рекомендуємо це робити. Якщо вам потрібна локальна змінна у функції, використовуйте форму let.\n"},"manuscript/03-04-Functions.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-04-Functions.html","title":"Функції","keywords":"","body":"Функції\nЗнайомство\nЧас переходити до активних дій! Функції у ClojureScript - це так звані об’єкти першого класу: за своєю поведінкою вони не відрізняються від інших типів. Такі функції можна передавати як аргументи або отримати як значення. Контекст при цьому завжди визначається статично. У певних ситуаціях ClojureScript підтримує динамічне визначення контексту, але про це ми поговоримо в іншому розділі.\nЗа більш детальною інформацією щодо визначення контексту направляємо читачів до статті з Вікіпедії), у якій вичерпно роз’яснюються різні типи визначення контексту.\nДля виклику функцій у ClojureScript використовується типова для діалектів Lisp префіксна нотація:\n(inc 1)\n;; => 2\n\nУ наведеному прикладі inc - це функція та частина середовища виконання (рантайму) ClojureScript, а 1 - перший аргумент функції inc.\n(+ 1 2 3)\n;; => 6\n\nСимвол + представляє функцію додавання. На відміну від мов родини ALGOL, де знаком + позначається оператор додавання, що допускає лише два параметри, у ClojureScript  символ + означає функцію, кількість параметрів якої не обмежена.\nПрефіксна нотація має значні переваги, в тому числі досить неочевидні. ClojureScript не розрізняє функції та оператори, кожен оператор - це функція. Префіксна нотація знімає обмеження на кількість аргументів будь-якого “оператора”, а також повністю усуває проблему їхнього пріоритета.\nВизначення власних функцій\nНеіменовану (анонімну) функцію можна визначити за допомогою спеціальної форми fn. Це один з існуючих типів визначення функції. У наступному прикладі функція приймає два параметри та повертає їх середнє значення.  \n(fn [param1 param2]\n  (/ (+ param1 param2) 2.0))\n\nФункцію можна визначити та викликати в одному виразі:\n((fn [x] (* x x)) 5)\n;; => 25\n\nПриступимо до створення іменованих функцій. Але спочатку спитаємо себе, що таке іменована функція? Все дуже просто: у ClojureScript, функції - це об’єкти першого класу, що поводяться як будь-які інші значення, тому іменування функції - це її поєднання з певним символом.\n(def square (fn [x] (* x x)))\n\n(square 12)\n;; => 144\n\nТакож у ClojureScript існує макрос defn - синтаксичний цукор для більш виразного визначення фунцій:\n(defn square\n  \"Return the square of a given number.\"\n  [x]\n  (* x x))\n\nРядок, між ім’ям функції та вектором параметрів, називається документаційним рядком (docstring). Ці рядки будуть використані програмами, що автоматично створюють веб-документацію з сирцевих файлів.\nМультиарні функції\nClojureScript  підтримує можливість визначення мультиарних функції  - функцій зі змінною кількістю аргументів (термін “арність” вказує на допустиму кількість аргументів функції ). За синтаксисом мультиарні функції відрізняються від звичайних наявністю більш ніж одного тіла функції.\nРозглянемо на приклаlі:\n(defn myinc\n  \"Self defined version of parameterized `inc`.\"\n  ([x] (myinc x 1))\n  ([x increment]\n   (+ x increment)))\n\nРядок : ([x] (myinc x 1))  означає, що за наявності лише одного аргумента слід викликати функцію  myinc  із цим аргументом та числом 1 - у якості другого аргумента. Друге тіло функції ([x increment] (+ x increment))  означає, що якщо аргументів два, слід повернути результат додавання цих аргументів.\nНаведемо приклади використання мультиарної функції, яку ми щойно визначили. Зверніть увагу: якщо ми викличемо функцію із невірною кількістю аргументів, компілятор повідомить про помилку.\n(myinc 1)\n;; => 2\n\n(myinc 1 3)\n;; => 4\n\n(myinc 1 3 3)\n;; Compiler error\n\nЗАУВАЖЕННЯ: Концепція арності знаходиться за межами тем цієї книги, але ви можете ознайомитися з нею за цим посиланням: Вікіпедія.\nВаріативні функції\nІнший спосіб обходження із невизначеною кількістю аргументів - це створення варіативних функцій. Варіативні функції - такі функції, що приймають довільну кількість аргументів:\n(defn my-variadic-set\n  [& params]\n  (set params))\n\n(my-variadic-set 1 2 3 1)\n;; => #{1 2 3}\n\nСинтаксис варіативної функції передбачає символ & на початку вектора аргументів.\nСкорочений синтаксис анонімних функцій\nДля визначення анонімних функцій, ClojureScript  пропонує скорочений синтаксис із використанням макросу читання #() (як правило, використовується із однорядковими функціями). Макроси читання - це спеціальні вирази, що трансформуються у відповідну мовну форму під час компіляції. У цьому випадку - у вираз, що використовує спеціальну форму  fn.\n(def average #(/ (+ %1 %2) 2))\n\n(average 3 4)\n;; => 3.5\n\nПопередній вираз є скороченим записом наступного:\n(def average-longer (fn [a b] (/ (+ a b) 2)))\n\n(average-longer 7 8)\n;; => 7.5\n\nСимволи %1, %2... %N - це прості маркери позицій параметрів. Вони будуть імпліцитно оголошені під час інтрепретації макроса та конвертовані у вираз fn .  \nЯкщо функція приймає лише один аргумент, можна опустити число після символа%&. Наприклад, функцію, що підносить число до другого степеня #(* %1 %1)) , можна записати так: #(* % %)).\nСинтаксис також дозволяє використання варіативної форми із символом  %& :\n(def my-variadic-set #(set %&))\n\n(my-variadic-set 1 2 2)\n;; => #{1 2}\n\n"},"manuscript/03-05-Flow-control.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-05-Flow-control.html","title":"Керування потоком виконання","keywords":"","body":"Керування потоком виконання\nПідхід до керування потоком виконання програми у ClojureScript відрізняється від того, який зазвичай використовується в мовах JavaScript, C, та ін.\nРозгалуження з if\nПочнемо з основного: if. В ClojureScript if — це вираз з трьома параметрами: умова, вираз, що буде обчислений, якщо умова — логічне true, та вираз, що буде обчислений, коли умова — логічне false.\n(defn discount\n  \"You get 5% discount for ordering 100 or more items\"\n  [quantity]\n  (if (>= quantity 100)\n    0.05\n    0))\n\n(discount 30)\n;; => 0\n\n(discount 130)\n;; => 0.05\n\nБлок виразів у формі do можна використати, в даному випадку, для того, щоб мати декілька виразів в одній із гілок if. Більше про do в наступній секції.\nРозгалуження з cond\nДеколи простого if може бути недостатньо, оскільки в ньому немає else if. Макрос cond вирішує цю проблему.\nУ виразі cond можна записати декілька умов:\n(defn mypos?\n  [x]\n  (cond\n    (> x 0) \"positive\"\n    ( \"zero\"\n\n(mypos? -2)\n;; => \"negative\"\n\nТакож cond має іншу, дуже схожу, форму — condp, яка підходить краще, коли усі умови мають однакову предикату:\n(defn translate-lang-code\n  [code]\n  (condp = (keyword code)\n    :es \"Spanish\"\n    :en \"English\"\n    \"Unknown\"))\n\n(translate-lang-code \"en\")\n;; => \"English\"\n\n(translate-lang-code \"fr\")\n;; => \"Unknown\"\n\nРядок condp = (keyword code) означає, що функція = буде викликана на кожній умові з результатом виразу (keyword code).\nРозгалуження з case\nВираз розгалуження case схожий на condp. Головною відмінністю є те, що в case предикатою завжди буде =, а значення умов обчислюється під час компіляції. Саме тому ця форма ефективніша за cond та condp, але недоліком є те, що ці значення повинні бути статичні.\nОсь попередній приклад переписаний з використанням case:\n(defn translate-lang-code\n  [code]\n  (case code\n    \"es\" \"Spanish\"\n    \"en\" \"English\"\n    \"Unknown\"))\n\n(translate-lang-code \"en\")\n;; => \"English\"\n\n(translate-lang-code \"fr\")\n;; => \"Unknown\"\n\n"},"manuscript/03-06-Truthiness.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-06-Truthiness.html","title":"Істинність","keywords":"","body":"Істинність\nСемантика цього аспекту дуже різна у кожній мові (часто неправильна).

Все інше — розглядається як логічне true.\nМаючи можливість імплементувати протокол виклику (IFn, про який ми поговоримо пізніше), такі структури даних, як множини, можуть бути використані в якості предикати, тобто без використання допоміжної функції-обгортки:\n(def valid? #{1 2 3})\n\n(filter valid?

Локальні змінні, зазвичай, не змінюють свої значення. Якщо спробувати їх змінити, компілятор видасть повідомлення про помилку.\nЛокальні змінні створюються за допомогою виразу let. Вираз містить вектор і довільну послідовність виразів після нього. Вектор повинен мати пари значень, що описують зв'язування. Така пара складається з символу та виразу, значення якого буде зв'язано з цим символом. Локальні змінні доступні усім виразам, що містяться у тілі виразу let.\n(let [x (inc 1)\n      y (+ x 1)]\n  (println \"Simple message from the body of a let\")\n  (* x y))\n;; Simple message from the body of a let\n;; => 6\n\nУ цьому прикладі символ x зв'язаний зі значенням виразу (inc 1), що дорівнює 2, а y зв'язаний з сумою x та 1, що дорівнює 3. Вирази (println \"Simple message from the body\nof a let\") та (* x y) обчислюються зі значеннями цих локальних змінних.\nБлоки\nУ JavaScript фігурні дужки { та } виділяють окремий блок коду. У ClojureScript блоки створюються за допомогою виразу do і часто використовуються для виконання побічних ефектів, наприклад виведення у консоль або логування даних.\nПобічний ефект — це вираз, який нічого не повертає.\nВираз do приймає довільну кількість виразів, але повертає значення лише останнього:\n(do\n  (println \"hello world\")\n  (println \"hola mundo\")\n  (* 3 5) ;; this value will not be returned; it is thrown away\n  (+ 1 2))\n\n;; hello world\n;; hola mundo\n;; => 3\n\nТіло виразу let, про який ми говорили раніше, дуже схоже на вираз do тим, що воно теж приймає декілька виразів. Насправді, let містить в собі неявний do.\nЦикли\nФункціональний підхід в ClojureScript не передбачає наявність стандартного механізму для створення циклів за допомогою спеціальних конструкцій, як наприклад цикл for у JavaScript. В ClojureScript цикли створюються за допомогою рекурсії. Рекурсія іноді потребує більше часу на моделювання вирішення проблеми ніж цикли в імперативних мовах.\nБагато підходів, що використовують цикл for в інших мовах, досягаються за допомогою функцій вищого порядку — таких, що приймають інші функції.\nЦикли за допомогою loop/recur\nДавайте розберемось, як можна виразити цикл за допомогою форм loop та recur. loop містить вектор локальних змінних (так само, як let) та вираз, що ними оперує, а recur — циклічно викликає loop з новими значеннями цих змінних.\nРозглянемо приклад:\n(loop [x 0]\n  (println \"Циклічний виклик з \" x)\n  (if (= x 2)\n    (println \"Цикл закінчився!\")\n    (recur (inc x))))\n;; Циклічний виклик з 0\n;; Циклічний виклик з 1\n;; Циклічний виклик з 2\n;; Цикл закінчився!\n;; => nil\n\nУ цьому прикладі ми зв'язуємо значення 0 з символом x і виконуємо тіло циклу — вираз, у якому є умова. Під час першого виконання цього виразу, умова не справджується, тому recur повторює цикл з результатом виразу обчислення (inc x). Так буде продовжуватись, доки умова не виконається, і тоді цикл loop вийде з рекурсії, повернувши результат.\nЗауважимо, що за допомогою recur можна зациклювати не лише loop; recur в функції також створить рекурсивний виклик з новими значеннями аргументів:\n(defn recursive-function\n  [x]\n  (println \"Циклічний виклик з\" x)\n  (if (= x 2)\n    (println \"Цикл закінчився!\")\n    (recur (inc x))))\n\n(recursive-function 0)\n;; Циклічний виклик з 0\n;; Циклічний виклик з 1\n;; Циклічний виклик з 2\n;; Цикл закінчився!\n;; => nil\n\nЗамінюємо цикл for на функції вищого порядку\nВ імперативних мовах програмування цикл for часто використовується для ітерування даних і їх перетворення, зазвичай, це роблять, коли потрібно:\n\nперетворити кожне значення у колекції і створити нову колекцію з цими значеннями;\nвідфільтрувати значення у колекції за певним критерієм;\nперетворити колекцію у значення, коли кожна наступна ітерація залежить від результату минулої;\nвиконати обчислення для кожного значення в колекції.\n\nВ ClojureScript ці операції виражені за допомогою функцій вищого порядку та синтаксичних конструкцій; давайте розглянемо приклади для перших трьох випадків.\nДля перетворення елементів колекції ми використовуємо функцію map, яка приймає перетворюючу функцію та саму послідовність. Під час виконання функція викликається на кожному елементі з колекції і в результаті ми отримуємо нову колекцію:\n(map inc [0 1 2])\n;; => (1 2 3)\n\nПершим параметром в map може бути будь-яка функція, що приймає один аргумент і повертає значення. Наприклад, якщо б у вас був застосунок для створення графіків і вам потрібно було б створити графік функції y = 3x + 5 для ряду значень x, то ви могли б обчислити значення y наступним чином:\n(defn y-value [x] (+ (* 3 x) 5))\n\n(map y-value [1 2 3 4 5])\n;; => (8 11 14 17 20)\n\nЯкщо функція невелика, то можна використати анонімну функцію, у звичайному чи скороченому вигляді:\n(map (fn [x] (+ (* 3 x) 5)) [1 2 3 4 5])\n;; => (8 11 14 17 20)\n\n(map #(+ (* 3 %) 5) [1 2 3 4 5])\n;; => (8 11 14 17 20)\n\nДля фільтрування елементів послідовності ми використовуємо функцію filter, яка приймає предикату і послідовність, та повертає нову, в якій залишились тільки ті елементи, для яких предиката повернула true:\n(filter odd? [1 2 3 4])\n;; => (1 3)\n\nЗнову ж таки, першим аргументом в filter може бути будь-яка функція, що повертає true або false. В цьому прикладі ми створюємо колекцію, в якій кожен елемент — рядок довжиною менше п'яти знаків. (Функція count обчислює довжину значення.)\n(filter (fn [word] ( (\"ant\" \"crab\" \"duck\" \"fox\")\n\nФункція reduce використовується для перетворення колекції в значення. Цей процес називається згортуванням, коли колекція згортується у якесь значення через згортування попереднього згорнутого значення з наступним значенням в колекції. Функція reduce приймає згортуючу функцію та колекцію, а також необов'язкове початкове значення:\n(reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4])\n;; => 10\n\nreduce приймає будь-яку функцію, що приймає два аргументи та повертає значення. Першим аргументом буде згорнуте значення, другим — наступне значення в колекції. Функція повертає значення, що буде згорнутим (першим аргументом) в наступній ітерації. Наприклад, ось як можна використати reduce, щоб знайти суму квадратів усіх чисел у колекції (це часто використовується в статистиці):\n(defn sum-squares\n  [accumulator item]\n  (+ accumulator (* item item)))\n\n(reduce sum-squares 0 [3 4 5])\n;; => 50\n\n...те ж саме за допомогою анонімної функції:\n(reduce (fn [acc item] (+ acc (* item item))) 0 [3 4 5])\n;; => 50\n\nОсь приклад з reduce, що обчислює сумарну довжину усіх рядків у колекції:\n(reduce (fn [acc word] (+ acc (count word))) 0 [\"ant\" \"bee\" \"crab\" \"duck\"])\n;; => 14\n\nУ цих прикладах ми не використовуємо синтаксис для скороченого запису анонімних функцій, щоб вам було легше читати та розуміти їх. Але це не означає, що скорочений запис не треба використовувати.\nБудьте уважні з початковим значенням для reduce. Наприклад, якщо вам треба знайти добуток усіх чисел в колекції, то починати треба з одиниці, а не з нуля, інакше усі числа будуть помножені на нуль!\n;; неправильне початкове значення\n(reduce * 0 [3 4 5])\n;; => 0\n\n;; правильне початкове значення\n(reduce * 1 [3 4 5])\n;; => 60\n\nСтворення послідовностей за допомогою for\nВ ClojureScript вираз for використовується не для ітерування, а для створення послідовностей. Ця операція також відома як «sequence comprehension». В цьому розділі ми дізнаємось, як вона працює та як її використовувати для декларативного створення послідовностей.\nfor приймає вектор локальних зв'язувань та вираз, і створює послідовність, в якій кожним елементом є результат обчислення цього виразу з поточними значеннями локальних змінних. Давайте розглянемо такий приклад:\n(for [x [1 2 3]]\n  [x (* x x)])\n;; => ([1 1] [2 4] [3 9])\n\nУ цьому прикладі символ x зв'язаний з поточним значенням з вектора [1 2 3], а результатом обчислення усього виразу буде послідовність векторів з двох елементів, в яких другий елемент — квадрат поточного значення локальної змінної.\nfor може мати декілька зв'язувань. Це утворить вкладені цикли, так само, як декілька вкладених циклів for у інших мовах. Кожен вкладений цикл буде виконуватись для кожного поточного значення поточного циклу.\n(for [x [1 2 3]\n      y [4 5]]\n  [x y])\n\n;; => ([1 4] [1 5] [2 4] [2 5] [3 4] [3 5])\n\nПісля визначення локальних зв'язувань для поточних значень можна використати три модифікатори: :let — для створення додаткових локальних зв'язувань, :while — для виходу с процесу створення колекції, та :when — для фільтрування значень.\nНаступний приклад показує використання модифікатора :let; зауважимо, що локальні змінні створені у модифікаторі також доступні у основному виразі циклу:\n(for [x [1 2 3]\n      y [4 5]\n      :let [z (+ x y)]]\n  z)\n;; => (5 6 6 7 7 8)\n\nМи можемо використати модифікатор :while, щоб створити умову, яка призведе до виходу з процесу створення колекції, коли результатом її обчислення буде логічне false. Ось приклад:\n(for [x [1 2 3]\n      y [4 5]\n      :while (= y 4)]\n  [x y])\n\n;; => ([1 4] [2 4] [3 4])\n\nНаступний приклад показує, як використовувати :when для фільтрування значень:\n(for [x [1 2 3]\n      y [4 5]\n      :when (= (+ x y) 6)]\n  [x y])\n\n;; => ([1 5] [2 4])\n\nУсі модифікатори можна використовувати разом для вираження комплексного процесу створення послідовності:\n(for [x [1 2 3]\n      y [4 5]\n      :let [z (+ x y)]\n      :when (= z 6)]\n  [x y])\n\n;; => ([1 5] [2 4])\n\nКоли ми розглядали найбільш поширені випадки використання циклу for в імперативних мовах, ми зазначили, що іноді нам треба виконати якусь операцію для кожного значення в колекції, не створюючи при цьому нову. Звичайно це означає, що вам треба виконати деякі побічні дії для кожного значення в колекції.\nВ ClojureScript є конструкція doseq, що схожа на for, але після її обчислення повертається nil.\n(doseq [x [1 2 3]\n        y [4 5]\n       :let [z (+ x y)]]\n  (println x \"+\" y \"=\" z))\n\n;; 1 + 4 = 5\n;; 1 + 5 = 6\n;; 2 + 4 = 6\n;; 2 + 5 = 7\n;; 3 + 4 = 7\n;; 3 + 5 = 8\n;; => nil\n\nЯкщо ви хочете лише проітерувати колекцію і виконати побічну дію для кожного значення (наприклад println), ви можете використати спеціально створену для цього функцію run!, що внутрішньо використовує швидке згортування:\n(run! println [1 2 3])\n;; 1\n;; 2\n;; 3\n;; => nil\n\nПісля обчислення ця функція повертає nil.\n"},"manuscript/03-08-Collection-types.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-08-Collection-types.html","title":"Типи колекцій","keywords":"","body":"Типи колекцій\nНезмінність та стійкість\nРаніше ми вже згадували про те, що колекції у ClojureScript незмінні (immutable) та стійкі(persistent), але не пояснювали значення цих термінів.\nНезмінна структура даних, як свідчить назва, не може бути змінена, а саме: не дозволяється безпосереднє оновлення даних без створення допоміжних структур.\nПродемонструємо дію цього принципу у наступному прикладі: спробуємо додати нове значення до вектора за допомогою операції conj (conjoin).\n(let [xs [1 2 3]\n      ys (conj xs 4)]\n  (println \"xs:\" xs)\n  (println \"ys:\" ys))\n\n;; xs: [1 2 3]\n;; ys: [1 2 3 4]\n;; => nil\n\nЯк бачимо, додавши елемент до вектора xs, ми створили нову версію цього вектора, що містить доданий елемент.  При цьому вектор  xs  залишився в оригінальному стані, бо він незмінний.\nСтійка структура даних — це структура, яка при трансформації повертає нову версію самої себе та лишається не зміненою.  Завдяки техніці structural sharing  (спільне користування структурами) ClojureScript проводить такі трансформації ефективно з точки зору використання пам’яті та швидкості. Спільне користування структурами дозволяє при трансформації не дублювати більшу частину даних, спільних для старої та нової версії. Натомість копіюється лише необхідний для трансформацій значення мінімум даних.\nДалі ми розглянемо приклад спільного користування структурами, тому, якщо ви не цікавитеся деталями таких операцій, ви можете перейти одразу до наступного розділу.\nЩоб показати роботу спільних структур, порівняємо за допомогою предикати identical? оригінальну та нову версію списку та перевіримо, чи є частини цих двох версій тим самим обʼєктом:\n(let [xs (list 1 2 3)\n      ys (cons 0 xs)]\n  (println \"xs:\" xs)\n  (println \"ys:\" ys)\n  (println \"(rest ys):\" (rest ys))\n  (identical? xs (rest ys)))\n\n;; xs: (1 2 3)\n;; ys: (0 1 2 3)\n;; (rest ys): (1 2 3)\n;; => true\n\nЯк видно з прикладу, ми додали у початок списку xs нове значення за допомогою функції cons (construct) і отримали новий список ys, що містить доданий елемент. Далі, ми викликали функцію  rest  та отримали усі значення списку  ys,  окрім першого, та переконалися, що ці значення є тим самим об’єктом у пам’яті, яким є список xs. Отож, списки xs та ys мають спільну структурну частину.\nАбстрація “послідовність”\nПослідовність — одна з найважливіших абстракцій у ClojureScript. Послідовність можна розуміти як список, що може бути створений на основі елементу будь-якого типу колекцій. Це стійка та незмінна структура, як усі типи колекцій. Значна частина функцій стандартної бібіліотеки ClojureScript повертає саме послідовності.\nТипи колекцій, які можуть створювати послідовності, називаються \"seqables\" — “спископодібні”. Після виклику функції seq з ними ми отримаємо послідовність. Дві основні операції, які можна виконувати на послідовностях, це first (повернути перше значення) та rest (повернути усі значення, окрім першого). Обидві операції викликають функцію seq  з аргументами, які отримують:\n(first [1 2 3])\n;; => 1\n\n(rest [1 2 3])\n;; => (2 3)\n\nВиклик функції  seq  зі спископодібним об’єктом може привести до різних результатів залежно від того, чи був спископодібний об’єкт порожнім. Відповідно, функція seq поверне або значення nil, або послідовність:\n(seq [])\n;; => nil\n\n(seq [1 2 3])\n;; => (1 2 3)\n\nnext — операція, схожа на rest, але next  — повертає значення  nil, якщо передати їй послідовність, що містить лише один елемент або не містить жодного.\nЗауважимо, що у такому випадку порожня послідовність, як результат роботи rest, буде обчислена як логічне true,  у той час як nil, що буде результатом роботи next, обчислиться як логічне false.\nДокладніше про це розповідається у розділі про істинність цієї глави.\n(rest [])\n;; => ()\n\n(next [])\n;; => nil\n\n(rest [1 2 3])\n;; => (2 3)\n\n(next [1 2 3])\n;; => (2 3)\n\nВикористання багатозначності nil\nОтож, seq, при виклику з порожньою колекцією повертає значення nil, а nil обчислюється як логічне false. Ми можемо скоритатися цим знанням для виявлення порожніх колекцій. Такий прийом називають використанням багатозначності nil (nil-punning).\n(defn print-coll\n  [coll]\n  (when (seq coll)\n    (println \"Saw \" (first coll))\n    (recur (rest coll))))\n\n(print-coll [1 2 3])\n;; Saw 1\n;; Saw 2\n;; Saw 3\n;; => nil\n\n(print-coll #{1 2 3})\n;; Saw 1\n;; Saw 3\n;; Saw 2\n;; => nil\n\nnil не є ані спископодібним елементом, ані послідовністю, але усі функції, які ми розглядали раніше, приймають це значення.\n(seq nil)\n;; => nil\n\n(first nil)\n;; => nil\n\n(rest nil)\n;; => ()\n\nФункції для роботи з послідовностями\nФункції стандартної бібіліотеки ClojureScript, призначені для трансформування колекцій, створюють послідовності зі своїх аргументів та, в свою чергу, імплементовані за допомогою стандартних операцій на послідовностях, які ми розглянули у попередньому розділі. Завдяки цьому такі функції універсальні, бо ми можемо використати їх із будь-яким типом даних, що може бути перетворений на послідовність. Подивимося на використання функції map із різними спископодібними структурами:\n(map inc [1 2 3])\n;; => (2 3 4)\n\n(map inc #{1 2 3})\n;; => (2 4 3)\n\n(map count {:a 41 :b 40})\n;; => (2 2)\n\n(map inc '(1 2 3))\n;; => (2 3 4)\n\n\nЗАУВАЖЕННЯ: при виклику функції map із колекцією типу “мапа” функція вищого порядку отримує двохелементний вектор, що містить ключ та значення з мапи. Для доступу до ключів та значень у наступному прикладі використовується деструктурування:      \n\n(map (fn [[key value]] (* value value))\n     {:ten 10 :seven 7 :four 4})\n;; => (100 49 16)\n\nЗвичайно, така операція може бути проведена у більш ідіоматичний спосіб, якщо натомість передати map спископодібну послідовності, що містить лише значення:\n(map (fn [value] (* value value))\n     (vals {:ten 10 :seven 7 :four 4}))\n;; => (100 49 16)\n\nМожливо, ви вже помітили, що функції, які маніпулюють послідовностями, можуть бути викликані із порожніми колекціями, та навіть із значеннями nil, без помилки. У таких випадках вони лише повертають порожню колекцію.\n(map inc [])\n;; => ()\n\n(map inc #{})\n;; => ()\n\n(map inc nil)\n;; => ()\n\nМи бачили приклади із найбільш часто вживаними функціями, що працюють із колекціями — map, filter та reduce. Та, насправді, простір імен стандартної бібліотеки ClojureScript  пропонує велику кількість універсальних операцій на колекціях. Зауважимо, що значна частина операцій, які ми розглядатимемо далі, або працюють зі спископодібними типами, або можуть бути розширені до використання типів, визначених користувачем.\nПредиката coll? дозволяє перевірити чи є певний елемент колекцією:\n(coll? nil)\n;; => false\n\n(coll? [1 2 3])\n;; => true\n\n(coll? {:language \"ClojureScript\" :file-extension \"clojure\"})\n;; => true\n\n(coll? \"ClojureScript\")\n;; => false\n\nІснують схожі за функціональністю предикати для перевірки чи є певне значення послідовністю (seq?) або спископодібним типом (seqable?):\n(seq? nil)\n;; => false\n(seqable? nil)\n;; => false\n\n(seq? [])\n;; => false\n(seqable? [])\n;; => true\n\n(seq? #{1 2 3})\n;; => false\n(seqable? #{1 2 3})\n;; => true\n\n(seq? \"ClojureScript\")\n;; => false\n(seqable? \"ClojureScript\")\n;; => false\n\nДля колекцій, які можуть бути пораховані протягом фіксованого проміжку часу, доступна операція count. З рядками count теж працює, хоча рядки не належать ані до колекцій, ані до послідовностей, ані до спископодібних.\n(count nil)\n;; => 0\n\n(count [1 2 3])\n;; => 3\n\n(count {:language \"ClojureScript\" :file-extension \"cljs\"})\n;; => 2\n\n(count \"ClojureScript\")\n;; => 13\n\nМи можемо отримати порожній варіант певної колекції за допомогою функції empty:\n(empty nil)\n;; => nil\n\n(empty [1 2 3])\n;; => []\n\n(empty #{1 2 3})\n;; => #{}\n\nПредиката empty? повертає значеня true, якщо її аргумент — порожня колекція:\n(empty? nil)\n;; => true\n\n(empty? [])\n;; => true\n\n(empty? #{1 2 3})\n;; => false\n\nОперація conj додає елементи до колекцій. Нові елементи розміщуються на тих позиціях колекції, де це буде найбільш продуктивним для певного типу колекцій. При цьому не кожна колекція має визначений порядок.\nКількість аргументів conj  не обмежена. Розглянемо на прикладі:\n(conj nil 42)\n;; => (42)\n\n(conj [1 2] 3)\n;; => [1 2 3]\n\n(conj [1 2] 3 4 5)\n;; => [1 2 3 4 5]\n\n(conj '(1 2) 0)\n;; => (0 1 2)\n\n(conj #{1 2 3} 4)\n;; => #{1 3 2 4}\n\n(conj {:language \"ClojureScript\"} [:file-extension \"cljs\"])\n;; => {:language \"ClojureScript\", :file-extension \"cljs\"}\n\nСхильність до лінивої поведінки\nБільшість функцій ClojureScript, що повертають послідовності, не створюють одразу усю послідовність. Натомість вони створюють так звані ліниві послідовності. Ліниві послідовності генерують свій вміст у той момент, коли на нього надходить запит, зазвичай у формі ітерування. Схильність до лінивої поведінки дозволяє не робити більше роботи, ніж необхідно, та надає можливість розглядати потенційно бескінечні послідовності як звичайні.\nРозглянемо функцію range, яка повертає цілі числа у межах визначеного інтервалу:\n(range 5)\n;; => (0 1 2 3 4)\n(range 1 10)\n;; => (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)\n(range 10 100 15)\n;; (10 25 40 55 70 85)\n\nЯкщо викликати  (range) без аргументів, то результатом буде нескінченна послідовність цілих чисел. Не відтворюйте цю пораду у REPL, якщо не готові чекати на результат дуже довго, бо REPL прагне обчислити вираз цілком.\nОсь дещо штучний приклад. Скажімо, ви пишете програму для створення графіків і вам необхідно створити графік рівняння y= 2 x 2 + 5. Ви хочете відібрати лише ті значення x, для яких значення y не перевищує 100. Ви можете згенерувати усі числа в диапазоні від 0 до 100, що буде більш ніж достатньо, викликати функцію  take-while і передати їй необхідну умову:\n(take-while (fn [x] ( (0 1 2 3 4 5 6)\n\nПоглиблене вивчення колекцій\nМи познайомилися із абстрацією послідовності у ClojureScript та з деякими універсальними функціями для роботи з колекціями. Час перейти до вивчення окремих типів колекцій та операцій, які вони підтримують.\nСписки\nСписки у ClojureScript використовуються переважно для групування символів у програму. На відміну від інших діалектів Лісп, у ClojureScript значна частина синтаксичних конструкцій вимагає використання не списків, а векторів та мап. Код стає менш однорідним, але простійшим для читання, тому таке рішення цілком виправдане.\nСписки ClojureScript можна розглядати як однобічно пов’язані структури, де кожен вузол містить значення та вказівник на решту списку. Тому найбільш природним (та швидким) способом додавання нових елементів буде вставка на початку списку, адже для додавання нового елемента у кінці списку доведеться пройти весь список. Додавання елементу на початку здійснюється за допомогою функції cons.\n(cons 0 (cons 1 (cons 2 ())))\n;; => (0 1 2)\n\nМи вже використовували літерал () у значенні порожнього списка. Через те, що він не містить жодного символа, він не сприймається компілятором як виклик функції. Але не варто забувати: літерали, що містять елементи, слід цитувати, аби ClojureScript не обчислював їх як виклик функції:\n(cons 0 '(1 2))\n;; => (0 1 2)\n\nДодавання елементів до \"голови\" списку відбувається за постійний час, тому операція conj додає нові елементи саме на початку.  \n(conj '(1 2) 0)\n;; => (0 1 2)\n\nСписки та інші структури даних у ClojureScript при виклику функцій peek, pop, та conj функціонують як стек. Зверніть увагу: функція conj додає нові елементи до верхівки стеку і таким чином виступає як еквівалент операції push. При виклику зі списком conj додає елементи на початку списку, peek повертає перший елемент списку, pop — усі елементи, окрім першого.\nЗауважимо, що операції, які повертають стек — conj та pop — не змінюють тип колекції, з якої був створений стек.\n(def list-stack '(0 1 2))\n\n(peek list-stack)\n;; => 0\n\n(pop list-stack)\n;; => (1 2)\n\n(type (pop list-stack))\n;; => cljs.core/List\n\n(conj list-stack -1)\n;; => (-1 0 1 2)\n\n(type (conj list-stack -1))\n;; => cljs.core/List\n\nСлабке місце списків — ускладнений довільний доступ до елементу за індексом. Списки зберігаються у памʼяті як стурктури, подібні до однобічно зв'язаного списку, тому доступ до елементу за заданим індексом вимагає лінійного обходу, в ході якого буде знайдене необхідне значення, або виникне помилка виходу індексу за допустимі межі. Ці обмеження характерні також для неіндексованих впорядкованих колекцій — лінивих послідовностей та інших.\nВектори\nВектори належать до найбільш розповсюджених структур даних у ClojureScript. Вони використовуються як синтаксичні конструкти у багатьох випадках, де більш традиційні діалекти Лісп вимагають списків. Прикладом може бути декларація аргументів функцій або оголошення локальних змінних за допомогою let.\nСинтаксичний літерал вектора у ClojureScript передбачає прямокутні дужки []. Вектори також можуть бути створені за домогою операції vector або при виклику функції vec із колекцією:\n(vector? [0 1 2])\n;; => true\n\n(vector 0 1 2)\n;; => [0 1 2]\n\n(vec '(0 1 2))\n;; => [0 1 2]\n\nПодібно до списків, вектори являють собою впорядковані колекції різнорідних значень, але списки та вектори ростуть з різних країв: операція conj додає елементи на кінець вектора. Вставка нового елемента у кінці вектора займає фіксований час:\n(conj [0 1] 2)\n;; => [0 1 2]\n\nІнша відмінність векторів від списків полягає у тому, що вектори — це індексовані колекції, що підтримують довільний доступ до елементів за індексом та безпечне оновлення значень. Для отримання значення за обраним індексом використовується функція nth.\n(nth [0 1 2] 0)\n;; => 0\n\nВектори зʼєднують послідовні числові ключі (індекси) та значення, тому ми можемо працювати з ними як із асоційованими структурами даних. ClojureScript має функцію  assoc, яка отримує асоційовану структуру даних та множину пар типу \"ключ-значення\" та створює нову структуру даних, що містить значення, які відповідають зміненим ключам. Нумерація індексів починаються з нуля, що вказує на перший елемент вектора.\n(assoc [\"cero\" \"uno\" \"two\"] 2 \"dos\")\n;; => [\"cero\" \"uno\" \"dos\"]\n\nЗверніть увагу, використати фунцію  assoc можна із ключем, що вже міститься у векторі, або якщо задана позиція буде останньою у векторі:\n(assoc [\"cero\" \"uno\" \"dos\"] 3 \"tres\")\n;; => [\"cero\" \"uno\" \"dos\" \"tres\"]\n\n(assoc [\"cero\" \"uno\" \"dos\"] 4 \"cuatro\")\n;; Error: Index 4 out of bounds [0,3]\n\nМоже здатися дивним, але асоційовані структури даних також можуть бути викликані як функції. Вектору можна передати ключ та отримати повʼязане з цим ключем значення. Якщо заданий ключ відстуній, з'явиться помилка:\n([\"cero\" \"uno\" \"dos\"] 0)\n;; => \"cero\"\n\n([\"cero\" \"uno\" \"dos\"] 2)\n;; => \"dos\"\n\n([\"cero\" \"uno\" \"dos\"] 3)\n;; Error: Not item 3 in vector of length 3\n\nПодібно по списків, вектори також можуть функціонувати як стеки при виклику функцій peek, pop та conj. Але слід зауважити, що на відміну від списків, зростання векторів відбувається з кінця колекції:\n(def vector-stack [0 1 2])\n\n(peek vector-stack)\n;; => 2\n\n(pop vector-stack)\n;; => [0 1]\n\n(type (pop vector-stack))\n;; => cljs.core/PersistentVector\n\n(conj vector-stack 3)\n;; => [0 1 2 3]\n\n(type (conj vector-stack 3))\n;; => cljs.core/PersistentVector\n\nОперації map та filter повертають ліниві послідовності, але дуже часто при роботі з векторами ми очікуємо отримати вже реалізовану послідовність, тому існують еквіваленти таких операцій, що повертають вектори — mapv та filterv. Такі операції працюють швидше, ніж побудова вектора на основі лінивої колекції; також використання mapv та filterv робить ваші наміри більш чіткими.\n(map inc [0 1 2])\n;; => (1 2 3)\n\n(type (map inc [0 1 2]))\n;; => cljs.core/LazySeq\n\n(mapv inc [0 1 2])\n;; => [1 2 3]\n\n(type (mapv inc [0 1 2]))\n;; => cljs.core/PersistentVector\n\nМапи\nМапи у ClojureScript використовуються дуже широко. Подібно до векторів, вони виступають як синтаксичний конструкт, у першу чергу для додавання мета-даних до змінних. Будь-яка структура даних у ClojureScript може бути використана як ключі у мапі, але найчастіше представлені ключові слова, бо вони також можуть бути викливані як фунції.\nЛітерал мапи у ClojureScript — це фігурні дужки, що містять пари типу \"ключ — значення\". Також для створення мап доступна функція hash-map.\n(map? {:name \"Cirilla\"})\n;; => true\n\n(hash-map :name \"Cirilla\")\n;; => {:name \"Cirilla\"}\n\n(hash-map :name \"Cirilla\" :surname \"Fiona\")\n;; => {:name \"Cirilla\" :surname \"Fiona\"}\n\nЗвичайні мапи не мають визначеного порядку, тому операція conj  додає нову пару типу \"ключ-значення\" у невизначеній позиції. Операція conj при використанні з мапою має отримати останнім аргументом одну чи більше послідовностей пар \"ключ-значення\":\n(def ciri {:name \"Cirilla\"})\n\n(conj ciri [:surname \"Fiona\"])\n;; => {:name \"Cirilla\", :surname \"Fiona\"}\n\n(conj ciri [:surname \"Fiona\"] [:occupation \"Wizard\"])\n;; => {:name \"Cirilla\", :surname \"Fiona\", :occupation \"Wizard\"}\n\nУ попередньому прикладі порядок був збережений випадково, але за наявності великої кількості ключів ви побачите, что за нормальних умов порядок не зберігається.\nМапи поєднують ключі та значення і, таким чином є асоційованими структурами. Вони дозволяють додавати нові асоціації за допомогою функції assoc та, на відміну від векторів, дозволяють видаляти існуючі асоціації за допомогою функції dissoc. assoc також може актуалізувати значення існуючого ключа. Давайте подивимося на роботу цих функцій:\n(assoc {:name \"Cirilla\"} :surname \"Fiona\")\n;; => {:name \"Cirilla\", :surname \"Fiona\"}\n(assoc {:name \"Cirilla\"} :name \"Alfonso\")\n;; => {:name \"Alfonso\"}\n(dissoc {:name \"Cirilla\"} :name)\n;; => {}\n\nМапи — це функції від своїх ключів, що повертають значення за обраним ключем. На відміну від векторів, мапи повертають значення  nil, якщо обраний ключ у даній мапі не знайдений.\n({:name \"Cirilla\"} :name)\n;; => \"Cirilla\"\n\n({:name \"Cirilla\"} :surname)\n;; => nil\n\nClojureScript також має сортовані хеш-мапи, які за поведінкою схожі на несортовані мапи, але при ітеруванні зберігають порядок. Сортовану мапу із звичайним впорядкуванням можна створити за допомогою функції sorted-map:\n(def sm (sorted-map :c 2 :b 1 :a 0))\n;; => {:a 0, :b 1, :c 2}\n\n(keys sm)\n;; => (:a :b :c)\n\nДля створення мапи із довільним впорядкуванням ми можемо передати функцію sorted-map-by, яка використовується при порівнянні елементів. Функції для порівняння приймають два елементи та повертають значення -1 (якщо перший елемент менший за другий), 0 (якщо елементи рівні) або 1 (якщо перший елемент більший за другий).\n(defn reverse-compare [a b] (compare b a))\n\n(def sm (sorted-map-by reverse-compare :a 0 :b 1 :c 2))\n;; => {:c 2, :b 1, :a 0}\n\n(keys sm)\n;; => (:c :b :a)\n\nМножини\nЛітеральний синтаксис множин у ClojureScript складається зі значень, огорнутих у фігурні дужки: #{}. Також множини можна створювати за допомогою конструктору set. Множини являють собою невпорядковані колекції значень без повторення.\n(set? #{\\a \\e \\i \\o \\u})\n;; => true\n\n(set [1 1 2 3])\n;; => #{1 2 3}\n\nЛітерали множин не можуть містити дублікатів. Якщо випадково написати літерал множини із дублікатами, виникне помилка:\n#{1 1 2 3}\n;; clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Duplicate key: 1\n\nІснує багато операцій, що доступні на множинах, але ці операції знаходяться у просторі імен clojure.set і мають бути імпортовані. Пізніше ми розглянемо простори імен більш докладно, а поки що вам слід знати, що ми завантажуємо простір імен clojure.set та приєднуємо його до символу s.\n(require '[clojure.set :as s])\n\n(def danish-vowels #{\\a \\e \\i \\o \\u \\æ \\ø \\å})\n;; => #{\"a\" \"e\" \"å\" \"æ\" \"i\" \"o\" \"u\" \"ø\"}\n\n(def spanish-vowels #{\\a \\e \\i \\o \\u})\n;; => #{\"a\" \"e\" \"i\" \"o\" \"u\"}\n\n(s/difference danish-vowels spanish-vowels)\n;; => #{\"å\" \"æ\" \"ø\"}\n\n(s/union danish-vowels spanish-vowels)\n;; => #{\"a\" \"e\" \"å\" \"æ\" \"i\" \"o\" \"u\" \"ø\"}\n\n(s/intersection danish-vowels spanish-vowels)\n;; => #{\"a\" \"e\" \"i\" \"o\" \"u\"}\n\nПеревага незмінних множин у тому, що вони можуть бути вкладені. У мовах, де множини — змінна структура, при вкладенні можливе дублювання значень. У ClojureScript такого не станеться. Насправді завдяки незмінності усі структури даних ClojureScript можуть бути довільно вкладені.\nЯк усі колекції, множини також підтримують універсальную операцію conj.\n(def spanish-vowels #{\\a \\e \\i \\o \\u})\n;; => #{\"a\" \"e\" \"i\" \"o\" \"u\"}\n\n(def danish-vowels (conj spanish-vowels \\æ \\ø \\å))\n;; => #{\"a\" \"e\" \"i\" \"o\" \"u\" \"æ\" \"ø\" \"å\"}\n\n(conj #{1 2 3} 1)\n;; => #{1 3 2}\n\nМножини виступають як доступні лише для читання асоціативні дані, що приєднують значення, яке в них містяться, до себе самих. У ClojureScript, окрім nil та false усі значення обчислюються як логічне true, ми можемо використовувати множини як функції-предикати:\n(def vowels #{\\a \\e \\i \\o \\u})\n;; => #{\"a\" \"e\" \"i\" \"o\" \"u\"}\n\n(get vowels \\b)\n;; => nil\n\n(contains? vowels \\b)\n;; => false\n\n(vowels \\a)\n;; => \"a\"\n\n(vowels \\z)\n;; => nil\n\n(filter vowels \"Hound dog\")\n;; => (\"o\" \"u\" \"o\")\n\nПодібно до мап, множини мають сортований різновид. Сортовану множину можна створити за допомогою функції sorted-set та sorted-set-by, що є аналогами функцій sorted-map та sorted-map-by.\n(def unordered-set #{[0] [1] [2]})\n;; => #{[0] [2] [1]}\n\n(seq unordered-set)\n;; => ([0] [2] [1])\n\n(def ordered-set (sorted-`set [0] [1] [2]))\n;; =># {[0] [1] [2]}\n\n(seq ordered-set)\n;; => ([0] [1] [2])\n\nЧерги\nClojureScript підтримує стійкі та незмінні черги. Черги — найменш розповсюджений тип колекцій. Створити чергу можна за допомогою літерального синтаксису #queue [], але зручних функцій-конструкторів для створення черги не існує.\n(def pq #queue [1 2 3])\n;; => #queue [1 2 3]\n\nФункція conj додає значення у кінець черги:\n(def pq #queue [1 2 3])\n;; => #queue [1 2 3]\n\n(conj pq 4 5)\n;; => #queue [1 2 3 4 5]\n\nПри роботі з чергами варто памʼятати, що стекові операції на чергах не дотримуються звичної  семантики, а саме додавання та видалення елементів з одного кінця стеку. Фукція  pop видаляє значення з початку черги, але conj додає нові елементи на кінець черги.\n(def pq #queue [1 2 3])\n;; => #queue [1 2 3]\n\n(peek pq)\n;; => 1\n\n(pop pq)\n;; => #queue [2 3]\n\n(conj pq 4)\n;; => #queue [1 2 3 4]\n\nЧерги використовуються менш часто, ніж списки та вектори, але знання про їхнє існування у ClojureScript може стати у нагоді в певних випадках.\n"},"manuscript/03-09-Destructuring.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-09-Destructuring.html","title":"Деструктурування","keywords":"","body":"Деструктурування\nДеструктурування — це процес вичитування окремих частин з структурованих даних, наприклад колекцій. В ClojureScript є спеціальний синтаксис для деструктурування індексованих послідовностей та асоціативних структур даних, що використовується у локальних зв'язуваннях та в аргументах функцій.\nДавайте розглянемо приклад, щоб зрозуміти в яких випадках деструктурування може бути корисним. Звичайно, якщо вам треба прочитати лише перший та третій елемент з колекції, це можна зробити за допомогою функції nth:\n(let [v [0 1 2]\n      fst (nth v 0)\n      thrd (nth v 2)]\n  [thrd fst])\n;; => [2 0]\n\nНедоліком такого підходу є його надмірна багатослівність. За допомогою деструктурування це можна зробити у місці створення локальних змінних, використовуючи вектор:\n(let [[fst _ thrd] [0 1 2]]\n  [thrd fst])\n;; => [2 0]\n\nУ цьому прикладі [fst _ thrd] — форма деструктурування. Вона представлена у вигляді вектору, що використовується для зв'язування значень в колекції з символами fst і thrd відповідно до індексів 0 та 2 цих значень у колекції. Символ _ використовується як заглушка для значень, які нам не потрібні, у цьому випадку це 1.\nЗверніть увагу, що деструктурування не обмежене зв'язуванням у формі let; воно працює майже усюди, де можливо зв'язати значення з символом, наприклад, у формах for та doseq, а також у аргументах функції. За допомогою деструктурування ми можемо створити функцію, що приймає пару значень та міняє їх місцями:\n(defn swap-pair [[fst snd]]\n  [snd fst])\n\n(swap-pair [1 2])\n;; => [2 1]\n\n(swap-pair '(3 4))\n;; => [4 3]\n\nДеструктурування за позицією в колекції з допомогою вектора добре підходить для вичитування значень з індексованих послідовностей, але інколи ми не хочемо відкидати інші аргументи послідовності. Символ & використовується в деструктуруванні для групування залишкових аргументів в окрему послідовність так само, як і в аргументах варіаційних функцій:\n(let [[fst snd & more] (range 10)]\n  {:first fst\n   :snd snd\n   :rest more})\n;; => {:first 0, :snd 1, :rest (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)}\n\nУ цьому прикладі перше значення в колекції, з індексом 0, зв'язане з символом fst, друге, з індексом 1, — з snd, а усі інші, починаючи з індексу 2 і до кінця, — з символом more.\nІноді разом з деструктуруванням нам також може бути потрібна уся структура даних. Це можна зробити за допомогою ключового слова :as, яке зв'язує початкове значення з символом, що записаний після :as у формі деструктурування:\n(let [[fst snd & more :as original] (range 10)]\n  {:first fst\n   :snd snd\n   :rest more\n   :original original})\n;; => {:first 0, :snd 1, :rest (2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9), :original (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)}\n\nАсоціативні колекції також можна деструктурувати. На відміну від індексованих колекцій, де використовується вектор, така форма деструктурування представлена у вигляді мапи. В цій мапі ключі — це символи, з якими будуть зв'язані значення з оригінальної мапи, а значення — це ключі з оригінальної мапи, значення яких ми хочемо зв'язати з символами у формі деструктурування. Давайте розглянемо наступий приклад:\n(let [{language :language} {:language \"ClojureScript\"}]\n  language)\n;; => \"ClojureScript\"\n\nУ цьому прикладі ми дістаємо значення по ключу :language і зв'язуємо його з символом language. Коли у мапі немає значення відповідного до ключа, значенням символу буде nil:\n(let [{name :name} {:language \"ClojureScript\"}]\n  name)\n;; => nil\n\nВ асоціативному деструктуруванні можливо задавати значення за замовчуванням для символів, що не мають значення в мапі по зазначеному ключу. Для цього використовується ключове слово :or та мапа зі зв'язуваннями по замовчуванню після нього:\n(let [{name :name :or {name \"Anonymous\"}} {:language \"ClojureScript\"}]\n  name)\n;; => \"Anonymous\"\n\n(let [{name :name :or {name \"Anonymous\"}} {:name \"Cirilla\"}]\n  name)\n;; => \"Cirilla\"\n\nАсоціативне деструктурування також підтримує зв'язування символу з оригінальним значенням за допомогою ключового слова :as у формі деструктурування:\n(let [{name :name :as person} {:name \"Cirilla\" :age 49}]\n  [name person])\n;; => [\"Cirilla\" {:name \"Cirilla\" :age 49}]\n\nВ асоціативних структурах даних ключами можуть бути не лише ключові слова. Числа, рядки, символи та інші структури даних теж можуть бути ключами, тому ми також можемо використовувати їх у деструктуруванні. Якщо ключ — це символ, його треба взяти у лапки, щоб представити як структуру даних, а не змінну, у якої є деяке значення:\n(let [{one 1} {0 \"zero\" 1 \"one\"}]\n  one)\n;; => \"one\"\n\n(let [{name \"name\"} {\"name\" \"Cirilla\"}]\n  name)\n;; => \"Cirilla\"\n\n(let [{lang 'language} {'language \"ClojureScript\"}]\n  lang)\n;; => \"ClojureScript\"\n\nЗазвичай значення у деструктуруванні мапи зв'язують з символами з таким же ім'ям, як і ключі у цій мапі (наприклад, значення по ключу :language до символу language). Оскільки ключами звичайно бувають ключові слова, рядки або символи, в ClojureScript для цих випадків є скорочений синтаксис деструктурування.\nМи покажемо приклади для всіх типів ключів, починаючи з ключового слова, з використанням :keys:\n(let [{:keys [name surname]} {:name \"Cirilla\" :surname \"Fiona\"}]\n  [name surname])\n;; => [\"Cirilla\" \"Fiona\"]\n\nЯк ви можете бачити, ключове слово :keys та вектор символів утворюють локальні змінні зі значеннями відповідно до ключів у мапі. Символи у векторі повинні мати таке ж ім'я, як і відповідні ключі. Такий запис є скороченим еквівалентом {name :name surname :surname}.\nСкорочена форма для рядків та символів працює точно так, як і :keys, але з використанням :strs та :syms відповідно:\n(let [{:strs [name surname]} {\"name\" \"Cirilla\" \"surname\" \"Fiona\"}]\n  [name surname])\n;; => [\"Cirilla\" \"Fiona\"]\n\n(let [{:syms [name surname]} {'name \"Cirilla\" 'surname \"Fiona\"}]\n  [name surname])\n;; => [\"Cirilla\" \"Fiona\"]\n\nЦікавою особливістю деструктурування є те, що форми можна вкладувати для вичитування вкладених значень, при цьому це легко читається, оскільки форма деструктурування описує структуру самої колекції:\n(let [{[fst snd] :languages} {:languages [\"ClojureScript\" \"Clojure\"]}]\n  [snd fst])\n;; => [\"Clojure\" \"ClojureScript\"]\n\n"},"manuscript/03-10-Threading-Macros.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-10-Threading-Macros.html","title":"Потокові макроси","keywords":"","body":"Потокові макроси\nПотокові макроси, також відомі як функції–стрілки, використовуються для запису вкладених викликів функцій у простішому форматі, що більш зрозумілий для читання.\nУявіть, що у вас є вираз (f (g (h x))), в якому функція f отримує результат обчислення функції g і так далі, з навіть більшою кількістю вкладених викликів. За допомогою потокового макросу -> такий вираз можна записати як (-> x (h) (g) (f)), що набагато легше читати.\nЦе синтаксичний цукор, бо функція–стрілка насправді є макросом, що перетворює вираз (-> x (h) (g) (f)) в (f (g (h x))) на етапі компілювання коду в JavaScript.\nПрийміть до уваги, що круглі дужки навколо h, g та f — необов'язкові, якщо ці функції не мають додаткових параметрів. Тобто вираз (f (g (h x))) можна записати, як (-> x h g f).\nМакрос першого потоку (->)\nЙого називають макросом першого потоку тому, що він встановлює значення першого аргументу для всіх виразів.\nНумо розглянемо наступний приклад без потокового макросу:\n(def book {:name \"Lady of the Lake\"\n           :readers 0})\n\n(update (assoc book :age 1999) :readers inc)\n;; => {:name \"Lady of the lake\" :age 1999 :readers 1}\n\nЗ макросом -> це буде виглядати так:\n(-> book\n    (assoc :age 1999)\n    (update :readers inc))\n;; => {:name \"Lady of the lake\" :age 1999 :readers 1}\n\nУ ClojureScript функції, що трансформують структури даних завжди приймають дані першим аргументом.

Бо у ClojureScript функції, що трансформують послідовності та колекції, завжди приймають дані останнім аргументом.\nПотоковий макрос (as->)\nІнколи може бути так, що макроси першого та останнього потоку незручно використовувати. В таких випадках використовується макрос as->, що дозволяє встановити значення на довільне місце для кожного виразу окремо, а не лише в початок чи кінець виразу.\nЦей макрос приймає два значення і довільну кількість виразів. Як і в звичайному потоковому макросі, перший аргумент — це значення, яке буде встановлено аргументом у всі вирази. А от другим аргументом повинен бути символ, з яким воно буде зв’язане. Цей символ використовується у всіх виразах в макросі для встановлення значення на довільне місце в аргументах функцій.\nДавайте розглянемо приклад:\n(as-> numbers $\n  (map inc $)\n  (filter odd? $)\n  (first $)\n  (hash-map :result $ :id 1))\n;; => {:result 3 :id 1}\n\nПотокові макроси some-> та some->>\nЩе одна пара потокових макросів для спеціальних випадків.

Простори імен схожі на пакети в Java або модулі в Ruby та Python. Вони створюються за допомогою макросу ns. Якщо ви бачили код на ClojureScript, ви могли помітити щось подібне на початку кожного файлу:\n(ns myapp.core\n  \"Some docstring for the namespace.\")\n\n(def x \"hello\")\n\nПростори імен динамічні, що дає змогу створювати їх у будь-який час. Існує домовленість, що на кожен файл повинно бути по одному простору імен. Зазвичай, простір імен створюється на початку файлу, після якого може бути рядок з документацією.\nРаніше ми розглянули змінні та символи. Кожна змінна зв'язана з простором імен, в якому вона створена. Якщо створити змінну окремо від простору імен, вона автоматично буде зв'язана з простором імен cljs.user, що існує за замовчуванням:\n(def x \"hello\")\n;; => #'cljs.user/x\n\nЗавантаження інших просторів імен\nСтворювати простори імен та змінні в них дуже просто, але в цьому не було б сенсу, якщо не можна було б використовувати символи з інших просторів імен. Макрос ns вміє завантажувати інші простори імен і має для цього наступний синтаксис:\n(ns myapp.main\n  (:require myapp.core\n            clojure.string))\n\n(clojure.string/upper-case myapp.core/x)\n;; => \"HELLO\"\n\nЯк ви можете бачити, ми використовуємо повністю кваліфіковані імена (простір імен + ім'я символу) для доступу до змінних та функцій з іншого простору імен.\nХоч так ми й можемо використовувати змінні з інших просторів імен, цей спосіб надмірно багатослівний. Буде дуже незручно, якщо простори імен матимуть довгі імена. Директива :as використовується для створення додаткових (звичайно коротших) імен для просторів імен. Ось як це виглядає:\n(ns myapp.main\n  (:require [myapp.core :as core]\n            [clojure.string :as str]))\n\n(str/upper-case core/x)\n;; => \"HELLO\"\n\nТакож в ClojureScript можна посилатися лише на конкретні змінні та функції з іншого простору імен за допомогою директиви :refer, після якої записується вектор символів, що відповідають іменам функцій та змінних з цього простору імен. Фактично, такі змінні стають частиною поточного простору імен.\n(ns myapp.main\n  (:require [clojure.string :refer [upper-case]]))\n(upper-case x)\n;; => \"HELLO\"\n\nІ нарешті, ви повинні знати, що все, що є у просторі імен cljs.core, автоматично завантажується у всі простори імен, тому змінні та функції з цього простору імен не потребують явного завантаження. Інколи ви можете створити змінну з ім'ям, яке вже є в cljs.core, що призведе до конфлікту. Для цього в макросі ns є директива, що дозволяє вказувати імена, які не будуть завантажені в поточний простір імен.\nРозглянемо такий приклад:\n(ns myapp.main\n  (:refer-clojure :exclude [min]))\n\n(defn min\n  [x y]\n  (if (> x y)\n    y\n    x))\n\nТакож в макросі ns є інші директиви, як от :import для завантаження класів з коду батьківської платформи, та :require-macros, про яку ми поговоримо пізніше.\nПростори імен та імена файлів\nWhen you have a namespace like myapp.core, the code must be in a file named\ncore.cljs inside the myapp directory.

Ця техніка є дуже поганою практикою.\nМи не можемо довіряти мовам, що дозволяють переписувати методи, які ви використовуєте у себе, іншими бібліотеками; коли таке трапляється, поведінка програми може бути непередбаченою.\nТакі симптоми зазвичай називають проблемою виразу (expression problem); дізнайтеся більше за посиланням: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem\nПротоколи\nВ ClojureScript примітив для створення «інтерфейсів» називається протокол. Протокол складається з імені та набору функцій. Усі аргументи функцій мають хоча б один аргумент, що відповідає об'єкту this у JavaScript або self у Python.\nПротоколи забезпечують поліморфізм на основі типів.

В громаді Clojure–розробників існує багато різних думок на рахунок того, як повинен використовуватись префікс «I». На нашу думку, це прийнятне рішення для запобігання конфлікту імен. У той же час, не використовувати префікс «I» не є поганою практикою.\n\nЗ точки зору користувача, функції протоколів — це звичайні функції, що створені у тому ж просторі імен, де і сам протокол.

Це можна зробити декількома способами.\nМайже завжди ви будете використовувати макроси extend-protocol або extend-type. Ось як виглядає синтаксис extend-type:\n(extend-type TypeA\n  ProtocolA\n  (function-from-protocol-a [this]\n    ;; імплементація тут\n    )\n\n  ProtocolB\n  (function-from-protocol-b-1 [this parameter1]\n    ;; імплементація тут\n    )\n  (function-from-protocol-b-2 [this parameter1 parameter2]\n    ;; імплементація тут\n    ))\n\nВи можете побачити, що вираз extend-type розширює один тип довільною кількістю протоколів.\nДавайте використаємо раніше створений протокол IInvertible:\n(extend-type string\n  IInvertible\n  (invert [this] (apply str (reverse this))))\n\n(extend-type cljs.core.List\n  IInvertible\n  (invert [this] (reverse this)))\n\n(extend-type cljs.core.PersistentVector\n  IInvertible\n  (invert [this] (into [] (reverse this))))\n\nВи могли помітити, що ми використали символ string замість js/String, коли розширювали протоколом тип–рядок. Це тому, що типи з JavaScript не можна розширювати. Якщо ви спробуєте розширити тип js/String, компілятор сповістить про це показавши помилку.\nТому, якщо ви хочете розширити типи з JavaScript, замість js/Number, js/String, js/Object, js/Array, js/Boolean та js/Function треба використати спеціальні символи: number, string, object, array, boolean and function.\nТепер можна випробувати нашу імплементацію протоколу:\n(invert \"abc\")\n;; => \"cba\"\n\n(invert 0)\n;; => 0\n\n(invert '(1 2 3))\n;; => (3 2 1)\n\n(invert [1 2 3])\n;; => [3 2 1]\n\nextend-protocol працює навпаки; маючи протокол, цей макрос дозволяє додати імплементацію до декількох типів одразу. Ось, як виглядає синтаксис:\n(extend-protocol ProtocolA\n  TypeA\n  (function-from-protocol-a [this]\n    ;; імплементація тут\n    )\n\n  TypeB\n  (function-from-protocol-a [this]\n    ;; імплементація тут\n    ))\n\nПопередній приклад можна переписати наступним чином:\n(extend-protocol IInvertible\n  string\n  (invert [this] (apply str (reverse this)))\n\n  cljs.core.List\n  (invert [this] (reverse this))\n\n  cljs.core.PersistentVector\n  (invert [this] (into [] (reverse this))))\n\nВикористання протоколів з ClojureScript\nClojureScript побудована на абстракціях, що створені за допомогою протоколів. Майже будь-яка поведінка в мові може бути адаптована до зовнішніх бібліотек. Давайте розглянемо реальний приклад.\nУ минулих частинах ми розглянули різні типи колекцій. В цьому прикладі ми використаємо set. Подивіться на цей код:\n(def mynums #{1 2})\n\n(filter mynums [1 2 4 5 1 3 4 5])\n;; => (1 2 1)\n\nЩо тут відбувається? У цьому випадку тип set імплементує протокол IFn, що є абстракцією для функцій або всього, що може бути викликаним як функція. Таким чином set, може бути використаний як предиката.\nДобре, та що, якщо ми хочемо використати регулярний вираз як предикату для фільтрування колекції рядків:\n(filter #\"^foo\" [\"haha\" \"foobar\" \"baz\" \"foobaz\"])\n;; TypeError: Cannot call undefined\n\nМи одержали помилку, бо тип RegExp не імплементує протокол IFn, тому він і не може бути використаний як функція. Але це можна легко змінити:\n(extend-type js/RegExp\n  IFn\n  (-invoke\n   ([this a]\n     (re-find this a))))\n\nДавайте проаналізуємо цей приклад: ми розширили тип js/RegExp імплементацією функції invoke у протоколі IFn. Щоб регулярний вираз а поводився як функція, в імплементації нам треба виконати операцію re-find з об'єктом виразу та патерном.\nТепер ви можете використати регулярний вираз як предикату, наприклад, в функції filter:\n(filter #\"^foo\" [\"haha\" \"foobar\" \"baz\" \"foobaz\"])\n;; => (\"foobar\" \"foobaz\")\n\nАналіз за допомогою протоколів\nВ ClojureScript є корисна функція для аналізу (introspection) даних через протоколи: satisfies?. За допомогою цієї функції можна перевірити об'єкт (інстанс типу) на наявність імплементації конкретного протоколу.\nНаприклад, ось так ми можемо перевірити, що set імплементує протокол IFn:\n(satisfies? IFn #{1})\n;; => true\n\nМультиметоди\nРаніше ми говорили про протоколи, що вирішують проблему поліморфізму, яка трапляється доволі часто — визначення за типом. Та за деяких обставин протоколи можуть обмежувати. Для таких випадків існують мультиметоди.\nМультиметоди не обмежені визначенням по типу; вони дозволяють визначати за типом декількох аргументів та значенню. Вони також дозволяють утворювати спеціалізовані (ad-hoc) ієрархії. Як і протоколи, мультиметоди — це відкрита система, в якій зовнішні бібліотеки можуть розширювати мультиметоди для нових типів.\nДля створення мультиметодів використовують форми defmulti та defmethod. Мультиметод створюється за допомогою defmulti і приймає функцію, що визначає метод. Ось, як це виглядає:\n(defmulti say-hello\n  \"Поліморфна функція, що повертає повідомлення з вітанням\n  в залежності від значення ключа `:locale`,\n  у якого встановлено значення за замовчуванням `:en`\"\n  (fn [param] (:locale param))\n  :default :en)\n\nАнонімна функція у defmulti — функція, що визначає, який з методів повинен бути викликаний. Ця функція буде викликана кожного разу, коли ми викликаємо say-hello і повинна повертати деяке значення, що буде використане для визначення методу. У нашому прикладі це значення по ключу :locale в першому аргументі.\nІ нарешті, ми можемо імплементувати декілька методів. Використаємо для цього defmethod:\n(defmethod say-hello :en\n  [person]\n  (str \"Привіт \" (:name person \"Анонімний\")))\n\n(defmethod say-hello :es\n  [person]\n  (str \"Привет \" (:name person \"Анонимный\")))\n\nЯкщо викликати нашу функцію і передати в неї мапу з ключами :locale та :name, мультиметод спочатку викличе визначаючу функцію, щоб отримати визначаюче значення, а потім знайде імплементацію для цього значення і викличе знайдену функцію. Якщо такої імплементації немає, то мультиметод спробує викликати імплементацію за замовчуванням, якщо така є.\n(say-hello {:locale :es})\n;; => \"Привет Анонимный\"\n\n(say-hello {:locale :en :name \"Роман\"})\n;; => \"Привіт Роман\"\n\n(say-hello {:locale :fr})\n;; => \"Привіт Анонімний\"\n\nЯкщо імплементації за замовчунням немає, буде виведена помилка з повідомленням про те, що для використаного значення відсутня імплементація в мультиметоді.\nІєрархії\nВ ClojureScript ієрархії використовуються для побудови відносин у системі. Ієрархії створюють відносини між такими об'єктами як символи, ключові слова та типи.\nЗалежно від ваших потреб, ієрархії можна будувати локально чи глобально. Як і мультиметоди ієрархії не обмежені одним простором імен. Їх можна розширювати з будь-якого простору імен.\nГлобальний простір імен більш обмежений, що зроблено навмисно. Ключові слова та символи, що не прив'язані до простору імен, не можуть бути використані у глобальній ієрархії. Така поведінка допомагає уникнути несподіваних ситуацій, коли декілька зовнішніх бібліотек використовують один і той же символ по-різному.\nСтворення ієрархії\nІєрархічний зв'язок створюється за допомогою функції derive:\n(derive ::circle ::shape)\n(derive ::box ::shape)\n\nМи створили набір зв'язків між іменованими ключовими словами. У цьому випадку, ::circle та ::box є дочірніми для ::shape.\n\nПІДКАЗКА: Синтаксис ключового слова ::circle — це скорочений запис :current.ns/circle. Якщо обчислити його у REPL ви побачите, що ::circle насправді поверне :cljs.user/circle.\n\nІєрархії та аналіз\nВ ClojureScript є декілька спеціальних функцій для аналізу глобальних та локальних ієрархій. Це функції isa?, ancestors та descendants.\nДавайте розглянемо приклад з використанням цих функцій:\n(ancestors ::box)\n;; => #{:cljs.user/shape}\n\n(descendants ::shape)\n;; => #{:cljs.user/circle :cljs.user/box}\n\n(isa? ::box ::shape)\n;; => true\n\n(isa? ::rect ::shape)\n;; => false\n\nЛокальні ієрархії\nЯк ми вже говорили раніше, в ClojureScript також є локальні ієрархії. Вони створюються за допомогою функції make-hierarchy. Ось код з минулого прикладу переписанный з використанням ієрархій:\n(def h (-> (make-hierarchy)\n           (derive :box :shape)\n           (derive :circle :shape)))\n\nДля аналізу локальних ієрархій теж використовується функці isa?:\n(isa? h :box :shape)\n;; => true\n\n(isa? :box :shape)\n;; => false\n\nЯк ви можете бачити, в локальних ієрархіях ми можемо використовувати нормальні (неіменовані) ключові слова, а функція isa? повертає false, якщо в неї не передати ієрархію.\nІєрархії у мультиметодах\nОднією зі значних переваг ієрархій є те, що вони дуже добре працюють з мультиметодами. Мультиметоди використовують функцію isa? на останньому етапі визначення методу.\nРозглянемо приклад, щоб зрозуміти, що це означає. Спочатку ми створюємо мультиметод за допомогою форми defmulti:\n(defmulti stringify-shape\n  \"Функція, що виводить текстовий опис форми.\"\n  identity\n  :hierarchy #'h)\n\nКлючове слово :hierarchy вказує мультиметоду, яку ієрархію ми хочемо використовувати; без ієрархії мультиметод буде використовувати глобальну ієрархію.\nДалі ми створюємо імплементації мультиметоду, як за звичай, за допомогою defmethod:\n(defmethod stringify-shape :box\n  [_]\n  \"Форма коробки\")\n\n(defmethod stringify-shape :shape\n  [_]\n  \"Загальна форма\")\n\n(defmethod stringify-shape :default\n  [_]\n  \"Несподіваний об'єкт\")\n\nТепер подивимось, що відбудеться, коли ми викличемо мультиметод:\n(stringify-shape :box)\n;; => \"Форма коробки\"\n\nВсе працює, як і очікувалось; мультиметод викликає імплементацію по ключовому слову :box. Тепер подивимось, що буде, якщо викликати мультиметод з ключовим словом :circle, для якого імплементація відсутня:\n(stringify-shape :circle)\n;; => \"Загальна форма\"\n\nМультиметод автоматично визначає імплементацію за допомогою ієрархії. :circle є нащадком :shape, тому викликається імплементація :shape.\nНарешті, якщо передати у мультиметод ключове слово, для якого нема імплементації ні в ієрархії, ні створеної напряму, спрацює імплементація за замовчуванням, :default:\n(stringify-shape :triangle)\n;; => \"Несподіваний об'єкт\"\n\n"},"manuscript/03-14-Data-types.html":{"url":"manuscript/03-14-Data-types.html","title":"Типи даних","keywords":"","body":"Типи даних\nДо цього моменту, для представлення даних, ми використовували мапи, множини, списки та вектори. У більшості випадків такий підхід є оптимальним, але інколи зʼявляється необхідність визначити власні типи. У цій книзі ми будемо називати такі типи типами «дані» (англ. data types).\nТип \"дані\" має такі властивості:\n\nУнікальний тип, іменований чи анонімний, на базі типів батьківської платформи.\nПідтримує можливість вбудованої реалізації протоколів\nМає явно оголошену структуру, що використовує поля або замикання\nДемонструє поведінку, подібну до мап (через записи, див. далі)\n\nКонструкція Deftype\n Конструкція найнижчого рівня абстракції для створення власних типів у ClojureScript — це макрос deftype. Для демонстрації роботи цього макросу визначимо тип під назвою User:\n(deftype User [firstname lastname])\n\nПісля оголошення типу можна створити екземпляр типу User. У наступному прикладі крапка після назви типу User вказує на виклик конструктора.\n(def person (User. \"Triss\" \"Merigold\"))\n\nДоступ до полів створеного екземпляра здійснюється через крапку:\n(.-firstname person)\n;; => \"Triss\"\n\nТипи, визначені за допомогою макросу deftype (а також defrecord, який буде розглянуто далі), створюють обʼєкти, адаптовані до типів батьківської платформи, подібні до класів та повʼязані з поточним простором імен. Для зручності, ClojureScript також визначає функцію-конструктор під назвою ->User, яку можна імпортувати за допомогою директиви :require.\nНаголосимо на тому, що нам не подобається цей тип функції — ми віддаємо перевагу визначенню власних конструкторів із більш ідіоматичними назвами:\n(defn make-user\n  [firstname lastname]\n  (User. firstname lastname))\n\nЗамість виклику ->User ми використовуємо саме таку функцію.\nМакрос Defrecord\nЗапис(record) — абстракція дещо вищого рівня, ніж type; саме макросу defrecord слід віддавати перевагу для визначення типів у ClojureScript.\nЯк відомо, у ClojureScript  переважно використовуються чисті типи, такі як мапи, але для представлення сутностей наших застосунків найчастіше нам потрібні іменовані типи, і тоді у нагоді стають записи.\nЗапис (англ. record) — це тип, який реалізує протокол типу «мапа» і, таким чином, може бути застосований, як будь-яка мапа, але завдяки тому, що записи — це власні типи, через протоколи вони реалізують поліморфізм, заснований на типах.\nЯк наслідок, ми одночасно отримали переваги мап та типів, що можуть виступати у різних абстракціях.\nВизначимо тип User за допомогою запису:\n(defrecord User [firstname lastname])\n\nСинтаксис defrecord дуже схожий на deftype; насправді, за лаштунками макрос defrecord використовує deftype у якості низькорівневого примітивного типу для визначення типів.\nЗверніть увагу на те, як доступ до полів власного типу відрізняється від чистих типів:\n(def person (User. \"Yennefer\" \"of Vengerberg\"))\n\n(:firstname person)\n;; => \"Yennefer\"\n\n(get person :firstname)\n;; => \"Yennefer\"\n\nЯк ми згадували раніше, записи — це мапи, тому вони демонструють відподвідну поведінку:\n(map? person)\n;; => true\n\nТакож, подібно до мап, записи дозволяють створювати нові поля, які не були визначені від початку:\n(def person2 (assoc person :age 92))\n\n(:age person2)\n;; => 92\n\nЯк бачите, функція assoc поводиться очікуваним чином та повертає новий екземпляр того ж типу, але з новою парою ключ-значення. Але будьте обережні із функцією dissoc! Поведінка цієї функції із записами трохи відрізняється від поведінки з мапами: якщо видалене поле було опціональним, dissoc повертає новий запис, але якщо ви видалите обов'язкове поле, функція поверне порожню мапу.\nІнша відмінність від мап полягає у тому, що записи не можна викликати як функції:\n(def plain-person {:firstname \"Yennefer\", :lastname \"of Vengerberg\"})\n\n(plain-person :firstname)\n;; => \"Yennefer\"\n\n(person :firstname)\n;; => person.User does not implement IFn protocol.\n\nДля зручності макрос defrecord, подібно до deftype, надає доступ до функції ->User, а також до додаткової функції-конструктора map->User. Наша думка з цього приводу така сама, як і щодо конструктора, який створюється макросом deftype: ми рекомендуємо визначати власні конструктори.\n(def cirilla (->User \"Cirilla\" \"Fiona\"))\n(def yen (map->User {:firstname \"Yennefer\"\n                     :lastname \"of Vengerberg\"}))\n\nРеалізація протоколів\nОбидва примітиви для визначення власних типів, які ми розглянули, дозволяють вбудовану реалізацію протоколів (див. минулий розділ). Визначимо тип для прикладу:\n(defprotocol IUser\n  \"A common abstraction for working with user types.\"\n  (full-name [_] \"Get the full name of the user.\"))\n\nТепер ви можете визначити тип із вбудованою реалізацією певної абстракції, у нашому випадку — IUser:\n(defrecord User [firstname lastname]\n  IUser\n  (full-name [_]\n    (str firstname \" \" lastname)))\n\n;; Create an instance.\n(def user (User. \"Yennefer\" \"of Vengerberg\"))\n\n(full-name user)\n;; => \"Yennefer of Vengerberg\"\n\nМакрос Reify\nМакрос reify  представляє собою конструктор спеціального призначення (англ. ad hoc constructor), який дозволяє створювати об'єкти без попереднього визначення типу. Реалізації протоколів макросу reify такі самі, як і для deftype та defrecord, але на відміну від них, reifyне має доступних полів.\nОсь, як можна емулювати екземпляр типу user, який добре поєднується із абстракцією  IUser:\n(defn user\n  [firstname lastname]\n  (reify\n    IUser\n    (full-name [_]\n      (str firstname \" \" lastname))))\n\n(def yen (user \"Yennefer\" \"of Vengerberg\"))\n(full-name yen)\n;; => \"Yennefer of Vengerberg\"\n\nМакрос Specify\nМакрос specify! — це покращена альтернатива reify, яка дозволяє додавати реалізації протоколів до існуючих об'єктів JavaScript. Це може бути корисно, якщо ви хочете додати протоколи до компонентів стандартної бібліотеки JavaScript.\n(def obj #js {})\n\n(specify! obj\n  IUser\n  (full-name [_]\n    \"my full name\"))\n\n(full-name obj)\n;; => \"my full name\"\n\nspecify — це незмінна версія макросу specify!. specify можна використовувати із незмінним значеннями, які реалізують протокол ICloneable (наприклад, колекції ClojureScript).\n(def a {})\n\n(def b (specify a\n         IUser\n         (full-name [_]\n           \"my full name\")))\n\n(full-name a)\n;; Error: No protocol method IUser.full-name defined for type cljs.core/PersistentArrayMap: {}\n\n(full-name b)\n;; => \"my full name\"\n\n"}}}
